<h3 style="text-align: center;">Automated Deep Learning<br /> without ANY human intervention</h3>
<p>This is AutoDL challenge: the final challenge in <a href="http://autodl.chalearn.org/" target="_blank">2019 AutoDL challenges series</a>,&nbsp;part of <a href="https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2019/CallForCompetitions" target="_blank">NeurIPS 2019 competition program</a>!&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">There is NO prerequite to have entered previous challenges to enter this challenge.</span></p>
<p>In this new challenge, we propose datasets from all the different modalities of the previous challenges in the series: image, video, speech, text.&nbsp;We target these domains because deep learning (DL) methods have had great success recently in these areas. We hope that this will drive the community to explore automated designs of DL models. However, we do not impose that participants use Deep Learning. We also added tabular data&nbsp;&nbsp;(i.e. in feature vector representation), from the&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="dhtgD aw5Odc" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fautoml.chalearn.org&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNH4vjTbxzEHjdtzg19YMM8q9dm2kA" target="_blank">AutoML challenges</a>.&nbsp;Raw data are provided, formatted in a uniform tensor manner, to encourage participants to submit generic algorithms. All problems are multi-label classification problems. We impose restrictions on training time and resources to push the state-of-the-art further. We provide a large number of pre-formatted public datasets and offer the possibility of formatting your own datasets in the same way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a 2-phase challenge; we are presently running the first phase (feed-back phase). The final blind testing is scheduled to start Feb 14, 2020. Instructions will be posted.&nbsp;</p>
