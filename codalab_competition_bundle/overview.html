<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Welcome to the AutoDL challenge!</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">A collaborative effort to find the best way to automate Deep Learning</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The rule of the game is simple</strong>. Register if you have not done it yet, read the instructions (will take you 5 min.) and submit your code. It will then be trained and tested on the cloud, without human intervention whatsoever, on tasks you have never seen before, with time and memory limitations (2 hours of compute time per dataset). All problems are multi-label classification problems, coming from various domains including text processing, speech recognition, image and video processing. They lend themselves to deep learning solutions, but other methods may be used.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>This challenge is in test mode</strong>&nbsp;and run on the Codalab/Chalearn platform. This test is fully hosted at Google and nothing is shared externally (only accessed via corp network). The submissions will be deleted after the challenge ends. After this test phase, the challenge will be hosted externally by <a href="http://chalearn.org">CharLearn</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Please send feedback to</strong> <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/66L0SO2mZhSbultv2">go/autodl-feedback</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Known issues:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The upload submission button does not work when you are on a dataset subtab. Go back to the top "My Submissions" tab if this happens.</li>
<li>The "Learning Curve" button opens a new tab: close it to go back to where you were.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The "Leraning Curve" new page will be empty before the first result is computed.</li>
<li>Compute times are unformatted (hh:mm:ss.xxxxxx,where x is up to the microsecond).</li>
