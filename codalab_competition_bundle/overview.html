<p><br /> Machine Learning and in particular Deep Learning has achieved considerable successes in recent years and an ever-growing number of disciplines rely on it. However, this success crucially relies on human intervention in many steps (data pre-processing, feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter optimization, etc.). As the complexity of these tasks is often beyond non-experts, the rapid growth of machine learning applications has created a demand for off-the-shelf or reusable methods, which can be used easily and without expert knowledge. In this challenge, you are asked to provide code for "universal learning machines" (deep learning or others), which can learn and make predictions without human intervention (blind testing).</p>
