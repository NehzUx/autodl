<h2 style="text-align: center;">Fully Automatic Deep Learning<br /> without ANY human intervention</h2>
<p><br /> Despite recent successes of deep learning, designing good neural networks remains difficult and requires practical experience and expertise. This problem is drawing increasing interest, yielding progress towards fully automatic solutions. In this challenge your machine learning&nbsp;code is trained and tested on this platform, without human intervention whatsoever, on tasks you have never seen before, with time and memory limitations. All problems are multi-label classification problems, coming from various domains including text processing, speech recognition, image and video processing. They lend themselves to deep learning solutions, but other methods may be used.&nbsp;Raw data is provided, but formatted in a uniform manner, to encourage you to submit generic algorithms.&nbsp;</p>
