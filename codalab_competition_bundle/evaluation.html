    <h2>Evaluation</h2>
    <a name="evaluation"></a>
    <h3>Tasks</h3>
    The goal of this challenge is to expose the research community to large datasets of interest to Google.
All datasets are formatted in a uniform way, though the type of data might differ (image, audio, video, text, or tabular data).
The data are provided in a raw form (no feature extraction) to encourage researchers to use Deep Learning methods
performing automatic feature learning, although this is NOT a requirement. All problems are <b>multi-class classification</b> problems 
and are assessed with the <b>balanced accuracy</b> metric.
<br>
       The identity of the datasets and the type of data is concealed, though its structure 
       (e.g. whether features are in a spatio-temporal arrangement like in videos) is revealed.
<br>       
      The tasks are constrained by a <b> time budget</b>. The Codalab platform provides computational resources shared by
      all participants. To ensure the fairness of the evaluation, when a
      code submission is evaluated, its execution time is limited in time.

    <h3>Phases</h3>
    The challenge has two phases:
    <ul>
    <li> <b>Phase 1: feed-back phase.</b> You can practice on 5 datasets that are of similar nature 
    as the datasets of the second phase. You can make a limited number of submissions, 
    but you can download the labeled training data and the unlabeled test set. So you can either
    compute your submission at home and submit prediction results or submit your code. Your LAST
    submission must be a CODE SUBMISSION, because it will be forwarded to the next phase for final testing.
    <li> <b>Phase 2: AutoDL challenge phase.</b> Your last submission of the previous phase is blind
    tested on five new datasets. Your code will be trained and tested automatically, without human
    intervention.
    </ul>
       
    During the feed-back phase, the results of your last submission are shown on the leaderboard.
    The final ranking an prize attributions take only place in the last phase.
