<h3>Starting kit</h3>
<p>Everything you need to create a <strong>sample code submission</strong> and test it can be downloaded from the Files tab, under <strong>"Starting Kit"</strong>. We also provide small sample datasets under&nbsp;<strong>"Public Data"</strong>.</p>
<h3>Larger practice datasets</h3>
<p>We formatted for you a few more larger practice datasets:</p>

<h3>Data format</h3>
<p>Data are not pre-processed in a uniform feature vector representation; they include all data types representable as spatio-temporal sequences. We use a generic data format based on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/datasets#consuming_tfrecord_data">TFRecords</a>, used by <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow</a>. This format allows us to format any 3D+time data, including text, speech, image, video, etc. This will not however impose to participants to use deep learning algorithms nor even Tensorflow. If you want to practice designing algorithms with your own datasets, we provide <a href="https://github.com/zhengying-liu/autodl-contrib/tree/master/tfrecord_format">instructions to help you</a>.</p>
