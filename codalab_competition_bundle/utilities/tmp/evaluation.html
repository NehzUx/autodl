<h2>Evaluation [more or less what we want to do]</h2>
<p><a name="evaluation"></a></p>
<h3>Tasks</h3>
<p>The goal of this challenge is to expose the research community to large datasets of interest to Google. All datasets are formatted in a uniform way, though the type of data might differ (image, audio, video, text, or tabular data). The data are provided in a raw form (no feature extraction) to encourage researchers to use Deep Learning methods performing automatic feature learning, although this is NOT a requirement. All problems are <strong>multi-class classification</strong> problems and are assessed with the <strong>balanced accuracy</strong> metric. <br /> The identity of the datasets and the type of data is concealed, though its structure (e.g. whether features are in a spatio-temporal arrangement like in videos) is revealed. <br /> The tasks are constrained by a <strong> time budget</strong>. The Codalab platform provides computational resources shared by all participants. To ensure the fairness of the evaluation, when a code submission is evaluated, its execution time is limited in time. <img class="img-responsive" src="{{ ASSET_BASE_URL }}/AutoDL.png" alt="" /></p>
<h3>Phases</h3>
<p>The challenge has two phases:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Phase 1: feed-back phase. </strong>You are provided with a starting kit and public data to devleop your methods following a well defined interface. You can practice making code submissions. Your code will be blind tested on 5 datasets (you will not have access to). Your scores will be posted as soon as they are available on a public leaderboard.</li>
<li><strong>Phase 2: AutoDL challenge phase.</strong> Your last submission of the previous phase will be blind tested on a benchmark suite made of new datasets, having various degrees of similarity to the datasets of phase 1. The organizers reserve the right to eliminate from the benchmark suite datasets that will be too easy or too hard, as revealed by the performances of the participants.</li>
</ul>
<p>In both phases, your code will be trained and tested automatically, without human intervention.&nbsp;The final ranking an prize attributions will take place only in the last phase.</p>
