    This method will be called REPEATEDLY during the whole training/predicting
    process. So your `train` method should be able to handle repeated calls and
    hopefully improve your model performance after each call.

    Args:
      dataset: a `tf.data.Dataset` object. Each example is of the form
            (matrix_bundle_0, matrix_bundle_1, ..., matrix_bundle_(N-1), labels)
          where each matrix bundle is a tf.Tensor of shape
            (batch_size, sequence_size, row_count, col_count)
          with default `batch_size`=30 (if you wish you can unbatch and have any
          batch size you want). `labels` is a tf.Tensor of shape
            (batch_size, output_dim)
          The variable `output_dim` represents number of classes of this
          multilabel classification task. For the first version of AutoDL
          challenge, the number of bundles `N` will be set to 1.

      remaining_time_budget: a `float`, the name should be clear. If not `None`,
          this `train` method should terminate within this time budget.
          Otherwise the submission will fail.

    Args:
      Same as that of `train` method, except that the `labels` will be empty.
    Returns:
      predictions: A `numpy.ndarray` matrix of shape (sample_count, output_dim).
          here `sample_count` is the number of examples in this dataset as test
          set and `output_dim` is the number of labels to be predicted. The
          values should be binary or in the interval [0,1].
