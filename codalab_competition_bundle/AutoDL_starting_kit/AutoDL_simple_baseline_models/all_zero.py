"""An example of code submission for the AutoDL challenge.

It implements 3 compulsory methods: __init__, train, and test.
model.py follows the template of the abstract class algorithm.py found
in folder AutoDL_ingestion_program/.

To create a valid submission, zip model.py together with an empty
file called metadata (this just indicates your submission is a code submission
and has nothing to do with the dataset metadata.
