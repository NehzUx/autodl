This is a tutorial made for participants/organizers of AutoDL challenge on how to format data into the standard data format adopted by this challenge.

We strongly encourage participants to format their own data and **share with the community**, enriching the challenge and making it even more challenging, fruitful and more concretely, solving directly the problems within the participants' hands (almost free).

## What is the data format adopted by this challenge?

The data used in this challenge are in standard TensorFlow format: [TFRecords](https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/datasets#consuming_tfrecord_data).
